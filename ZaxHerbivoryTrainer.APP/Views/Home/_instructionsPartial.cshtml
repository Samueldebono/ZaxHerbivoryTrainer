        <p>Welcome to the ZAX Herbivory Trainer. This free app is designed to train researchers and students to visually estimate herbivory accurately. Visually estimating herbivory is advantageous to those: in the field, under time restrictions and sampling large volumes of leaves. </p>

        <p>To use this app and be trained successfully, you will estimate the amount of leaf damage on randomised images of leaves using the slider tool under the image. Answers range from 0% leaf damage to 100% leaf damage. After submitting your estimate, the correct answer will be displayed. Estimates that are within 0-1% of the actual answer are considered accurate (e.g. if the true answer is 5%, estimates of 4, 5 & 6% are considered accurate). </p>

        <p>After estimating 10 images, a running average of your estimate accuracy will be displayed. Your training will continue for as long as it takes the running average of your last 10 images to reach 99-100% accuracy.  </p>
